## 1. What this project is

**ECU_TESTER** is a real-time hardware-in-the-loop **car-ECU bench tester**. An
**ESP32-S3** acquires ~50 analog + digital automotive signals (and crank/cam
waveforms) in real time, and serves a **professional local web dashboard** over
its own Wi-Fi. The dashboard renders in a browser on an external display
(monitor/PC/TV), connected to the device's access point. It must also run a
full **simulation mode** with no hardware attached, for demos and development.

**Client / brand:** AL-AYED.

**Lineage (conceptual only — D0 = clean start):** the earlier proof-of-concept
**S-ECU** (`https://github.com/Alihk93/S-ECU`) validated the transport approach
(SoftAP + `esp_http_server` WebSocket, dual-core FreeRTOS, ADC1-only, lock-free
length-1 queue). ECU_TESTER **reuses those _patterns_ but is written from scratch** —
no S-ECU code or SVG art is copied in. On top of the shared transport it adds a
documented **packed-binary + CRC** protocol, a CKP/CMP **waveform oscilloscope**, and
a browser→server **command channel** for the simulation controls.

## 2. Hardware & environment

- **MCU / module:** ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 **N16R8** (16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM).
- **Framework:** ESP-IDF **v5.5.x** (pinned locally to 5.5.2).
- **OS / IDE:** Ubuntu · VS Code · Claude Code · GitHub · KiCad (PCB).
- **Network:** SoftAP. SSID **`ECU_TESTER`**, password **`00000000`** (WPA2-PSK — 8
  chars, the WPA2 minimum), IP **10.10.10.10** (non-default; firmware sets the AP
  netif IP explicitly — default SoftAP would be 192.168.4.1).
- **Display client (D8 = a):** Chromium in **kiosk mode on a mini-PC**
  (`chromium --kiosk --app=http://10.10.10.10`, autostarted by the OS). The
  ESP32-S3 has **no display output**; it is the *server*, not the renderer, so
  "boot into dashboard" is a property of the display device, not the firmware.
  (Avoid IE — its WebSocket support is effectively dead.)

---

## 3. Architecture — locked decisions

These are settled and carried forward from S-ECU unless a decision below reopens one.

- **SoftAP** at `10.10.10.10`, multiple simultaneous viewers supported.
- **`esp_http_server` serves the UI *and* hosts the WebSocket.** There is **no**
  standalone `esp_websocket_server` component — enable `CONFIG_HTTPD_WS_SUPPORT=y`
  and register the URI with `.is_websocket = true`, use the `httpd_ws_*` API.
- **Bidirectional WebSocket.** Server→browser telemetry *and* browser→server
  commands (the manual sim controls). This is new vs S-ECU.
- **FreeRTOS, dual-core:**
  - **Acquisition task pinned to core 1** — ADC oneshot + averaging, GPIO/timer
    edge capture, waveform ring buffers. Kept off the Wi-Fi core.
  - **Network/telemetry task on core 0** — packs frames, broadcasts to every live
    client via `httpd_get_client_list()` + non-blocking `httpd_ws_send_frame_async()`
    (writability-gated per client — see "Broadcast back-pressure" in §8).
- **Lock-free shared state:** length-1 queue with `xQueueOverwrite` (producer) /
  `xQueuePeek` (consumer) — always-latest snapshot, no mutex. Waveforms use a
  separate SPSC ring buffer (see ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Analog acquisition (D4=b, D7):** 5 analog channels — MAF, MAP, IAT, ECU-V,
  Sensor-V. Four precision channels (MAP, MAF, IAT, ECU-V) go through an external
  **ADS1115** (16-bit, I²C) for clean, monotonic gauge readings; the coarse generic
  **Sensor-V** meter uses one **internal ADC1** channel (oversampled). ADC2 stays
  unused (dead while Wi-Fi is active).
- **Digital acquisition (D3 = activity-only, D7):**
  - **Status lines (~14):** Battery, Switch, Start, ETC, Fan1/2, Fuel Pump, IMMO±,
    MRC±, IAC → **MCP23017** I²C expander (16 ch), polled ~50–100 Hz (these are slow).
  - **Coil ×8 + injector-regular ×8 + injector-GDI ×8 = 24 activity lines** → a
    **74HC165** parallel-in shift-register chain (3× 8-bit) read over SPI. Firmware
    latches "fired since last frame" per channel. **No dwell/pulse-width timing** —
    D3 is activity-only, so no per-channel capture hardware is needed.
- **High-speed capture — CKP/CMP1/CMP2 (D5/D6):** three dedicated GPIOs fed from the
  conditioning front-end (clean 3.3 V edges). **CKP = VR, 60-2** via a **MAX9926**
  adaptive-threshold interface; **CMP1/CMP2 = Hall** via divider+clamp (each input
  jumperable to accept the other type). Edge timing via RMT / GPTimer input capture →
  RPM + the scope trace.
- **Asset storage: LittleFS partition** (not `EMBED_FILES`). The dashboard is large
  and may include a photo; LittleFS lets the browser cache assets and lets us update
  the UI without reflashing the app. This diverges from S-ECU on purpose — see
  ARCHITECTURE.md §"Asset delivery" for the tradeoff.
- **Protocol: packed binary, little-endian, fixed layout, CRC16-CCITT, sequence
  numbers.** Fully specified in [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md). This replaces
  S-ECU's JSON because of the data volume (50 signals + waveforms).

### Two-tier data path (important)
You **cannot** stream 10 kHz × N channels of raw samples to a browser. Acquisition
runs fast on-device; the wire runs at a display-appropriate rate:
- **Telemetry frames** (analog + packed digital state) at ~**30–60 Hz**.
- **Waveform blocks** (CKP/CMP) sent as decimated windows and/or edge lists, not raw
  10 kHz streams. See ARCHITECTURE.md §"Waveform path" and open decision D6.
- Coil/injector "firing" bits are **latched since last frame** so short pulses are
  never missed between frames.

## 4. Decisions — RESOLVED (full log in [`OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](OPEN_DECISIONS.md))

All gating questions D0–D8 answered **2026-07-02**:

- **D0 clean start.** Written from scratch; no S-ECU code/art reuse (patterns only).
- **D1 AP.** SSID `ECU_TESTER`, password `00000000`, WPA2-PSK.
- **D2 monitor-only.** Read ECU outputs; no signal generation into the ECU. Manual
  controls exist only in simulation mode.
- **D3 activity-only** for coils/injectors (latched bit per channel; no timing).
- **D4 design the front-end here** (this KiCad project) — dividers/clamps/buffers,
  ADS1115, MCP23017, 74HC165, MAX9926, Hall clamps. See `hardware/README.md`.
- **D5 CKP = VR 60-2; CMP1/CMP2 = Hall** (inputs jumperable to either type).
- **D6 waveform = edge-list** primary (exact, tiny; ideal for missing-tooth), plus a
  coarse decimated envelope for the analog look; triggered single-shot deferred.
- **D7 expansion:** MCP23017 (slow status) + 74HC165 (coil/injector activity) +
  ADS1115 (precision analog). No capture-front-end MCU (D3 = activity-only).
- **D8 display = Chromium kiosk on a mini-PC** *(superseded for the smart-TV fleet by D9)*.
- **D9 (2026-07-13) display client = native Android TV app** — GPU-composited, removes
  the TV browser's software-render FPS ceiling. Firmware/protocol/assets unchanged; the
  app is another WS client on `/ws` (`Protocol.kt` = 4th contract mirror). `web/` kept as
  fallback, not deprecated. M1 slice (RPM needle) built + **verified on-device 2026-07-14**
  (60 fps + CRC-gate). See [`docs/ANDROID_MIGRATION.md`](docs/ANDROID_MIGRATION.md); build
  env in `android/README.md`.

**Next build targets (for Claude Code):** `i2c_bus` + `ads1115` + `mcp23017` drivers,
`hc165` shift-chain reader, `ckp_capture` (RMT/GPTimer) with 60-2 decode + RPM,
`ws_server` (telemetry packer + command handler), then the fresh web dashboard.
**Start with [`docs/M1_VERTICAL_SLICE.md`](docs/M1_VERTICAL_SLICE.md)** — a thin
end-to-end slice (one ADS1115 channel → gauge) that validates the wire contract on
hardware before scaling up.

**Contract invariant:** `firmware/ECU_Tester/main/include/protocol.h` and `web/js/protocol.js`
**must stay byte-for-byte in lockstep** with `docs/PROTOCOL.md`. Change all three
together, in the same commit, or the dashboard silently decodes garbage.

---

## 6. Build / flash / run

```bash
# firmware  (managed dep joltwallet/littlefs is fetched automatically on configure)
cd firmware/ECU_Tester
idf.py set-target esp32s3      # once; a bare first build would default to esp32
idf.py build

# flash the app
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor

# build + flash the web assets into the LittleFS partition (see docs/SETUP.md)
# (littlefs image is generated from web/ and flashed to the `storage` partition)
```

Connect the display device to Wi-Fi SSID `ECU_TESTER` (password `00000000`), open `http://10.10.10.10`.

> **Do not** silently retune `sdkconfig.defaults`, edit `partitions.csv`, change
> `CMakeLists.txt`, or remap pins unless the task requires it — these hit every
> build and flash. Call it out first.

## 7. House style & working rules (Karpathy guidelines)

Applies to every change in this repo:

1. **Think before coding.** State assumptions explicitly; if multiple readings
   exist, present them — don't pick silently. If a simpler approach exists, say so.
2. **Simplicity first.** Minimum code that solves the task. No speculative
   abstractions, no HAL wrapper around one `gpio_set_level`. Check the `esp_err_t`
   returns that actually fail; skip guards for impossible cases.
3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task needs. Match existing style. Don't
   refactor working code. Remove only orphans *your* change created.
4. **Goal-driven.** Define the pass/fail check up front (an `ESP_LOGx` line, a pin
   state, a scope trace, a heap watermark, a host unit test), then loop
   **build → flash → observe that signal → done**.
5. **Presentation:** reasoning step by step; code changes as VS Code-style diffs with
   `+`/`−`; flag every assumption; on any tradeoff, give options **and** a recommendation.

For ISR context: no blocking calls, use the `*FromISR` APIs. State task priority,
stack size, and core affinity whenever you add a task.

## 8. Status

Scaffold created; **all decisions D0–D8 resolved (2026-07-02)**. Front-end specified in
`hardware/README.md`; protocol signal set + scaling locked in `docs/PROTOCOL.md`.

**Build:** the firmware **compiles clean for `esp32s3`** on ESP-IDF v5.5.2 (`idf.py
build` green; app ≈ 0x56e10 bytes, ~89% of the app partition free). The LittleFS
managed component (`joltwallet/littlefs`, resolved 1.22.1) is wired via
`main/idf_component.yml`. `board_config.h` now carries the resolved D1 AP credentials
(`ECU_TESTER` / `00000000`) **and the committed GPIO pinmap** — the firmware mirror of
the `hardware/README.md` GPIO map (Sensor-V ADC1 GPIO4; CKP/CMP1/CMP2 = 5/6/7; I²C
SDA 47 / SCL 21 for ADS1115+MCP23017; 74HC165 QH/CLK/LD = 16/17/18).

**Bench (hardware bring-up):** the SoftAP + asset-serving path is implemented and
**verified on the device** — `wifi_softap_start()` brings up `esp_netif` + the default
event loop + Wi-Fi AP (`ECU_TESTER` / WPA2) at `10.10.10.10`, and the board boots
cleanly and stays up. (Earlier the stub skipped `esp_netif_init()`, so `httpd_start()`
hit lwIP with no TCP/IP task and the chip reboot-looped on an "Invalid mbox" assert.)
`littlefs_mount()` + `static_get_handler()` now serve the dashboard: a LittleFS image
is built from `web/` at compile time (`littlefs_create_partition_image(... FLASH_IN_PROJECT)`
in `main/CMakeLists.txt`) and flashed with the app; the handler streams files chunked
with per-type MIME + `Cache-Control` (long for media, `no-cache` for HTML/JS/CSS so a
reflashed UI shows immediately — a kiosk browser otherwise runs year-stale JS) behind a
`/*` wildcard route, with the exact `/ws` route registered first. Boot log confirms
`LittleFS mounted at /web` and `web root OK: index.html`.

**Web dashboard:** the AL-AYED layout (from Claude Design 2026-07-09) in the **flat
marine skin** (client decision 2026-07-10 after the bench TV measured 8 FPS on the
decorated version) is **served from the device** — 1920×1080 fixed canvas fitted to the
viewport (Blink `zoom`, fallback transform): top bar (DEVICE/UPTIME/white logo
`logo_w.png`/VOLTAGE/CURRENT 7-seg readouts, no ghost digits), status grid
(FAN1/FAN2/IMO/HIP/IAC), CKP-CMP canvas oscilloscope + decorative CAN, relay indicator
row, big RPM dial, six 0–5 V mini gauges (CTS/MAF/MAP/IAT/5V/IGF), and 8-cell
COIL/INJ/GDI banks with spark/spray bursts. One unified "white navy" background
(`--navy` #33516f), flat colors + 1px borders only — **no gradients, shadows, glows or
filters anywhere** (do not reintroduce). `app.js` is the view (global `ECU` API);
`js/live.js` maps decoded protocol frames onto it (coalesced and rAF-paced — at most
one DOM apply per painted frame with an 80 ms floor ≈ 12.5 Hz on healthy displays;
latched bits OR-ed, stale-stream watchdog forces reconnect). The page free-runs as a
demo until the first valid frame, then `.is-live` gates every animation behind real
telemetry. The CKP/CMP scope is a **parametric standing display** (three square waves
whose frequency tracks RPM, redrawn only when the RPM bucket changes — not a continuous
loop and not a plot of the WAVEFORM edge-lists, which the firmware **no longer streams
by default** as of 2026-07-12 — `s_wave_stream` in main.c, sim `--waveforms`; wire
format unchanged, and `protocol.js` discards any that arrive before its CRC pass).
`js/diag.js` shows an FPS/WS/age/res corner meter (tap or key D hides; `?diag=0`
disables it). CTS/IGF/CURRENT have **no protocol v1
field** — zeroed in live mode; HIP+PFC-OFF both show the Fuel Pump bit; banks show 8
channels (6-cyl sim fires 1–6). Signal map in `web/README.md`. `tools/sim_server.py`
(stdlib Python) serves `web/` + speaks the full binary protocol with the same generators
as the firmware sim — dashboard development needs no hardware:
`python3 tools/sim_server.py` → `:8090`.
**Universal old+new TV target (2026-07-11, extended 2026-07-12):** all `web/*.js` is
**ES5 classic scripts** (no `type="module"`, no `const`/`let`/`class`/arrows/template
literals) and the layout uses **flexbox + margins, not CSS Grid** — the client's older
TV (~Chromium 49–60) ran modules as no-ops (stuck in demo mode, no WebSocket ever
opened) and scrambled Grid layouts. The 2026-07-12 pass also purged **flex `gap`**
(needs Chromium 84+ — every gutter silently collapsed on the old TV), **`inset:`**
(needs 87+ — un-pinned the outer `.frame`), **`space-evenly`** (needs 60+) and
**`NodeList.forEach`** (needs 51+).
See `web/README.md` "Old-TV compatibility" before adding modern JS/CSS syntax.
**TV/kiosk perf rules are load-bearing** (the display browsers render single-threaded
in software): no per-frame `:root` CSS-var writes, stepped `steps()` animation timing,
animated sprites on cached layers (`will-change` + `contain: paint`), a **static/event-
driven canvas** scope (never a continuous rAF/setTimeout redraw loop, never mutated
SVG), needles rotate as element transforms, no `aspect-ratio`/`min()`, code served
`no-cache` / media long-cached — rules + reasons in `web/README.md`.

**Live data path — DONE end-to-end (firmware sim):** `ws_broadcast()` (client
enumeration + `httpd_ws_send_frame_async`) and both tasks are implemented. `acq_task`
(core 1) generates the slow signals — RPM, the four analog sensors as raw mV matching
the web transfer curves, status lines, IAC phase — into the length-1 snapshot; `net_task`
(core 0) integrates one crank-angle accumulator from RPM to derive the latched
coil/injector firing bits **and** the CKP 60-2 / CMP1 / CMP2 waveform edge-lists (so a
coil flash lines up with the crank trace), then broadcasts TELEMETRY (~30 Hz); WAVEFORM
edge-list streaming is implemented but **default-off** since 2026-07-12 (`s_wave_stream`
— nothing plots it; re-enable via SUBSCRIBE when that handler lands). **Verified on the
device** (before the default-off): WS handshake `101`, ~69 TELEMETRY + ~132 WAVEFORM
frames in 2.5 s, telemetry decodes clean (idle rpm ~810, ecu_v ~13.8 V, coils cycling in
1-5-3-6-2-4 order), rpm breathing. This is the hardware-free simulation mode (CLAUDE.md
§1); the sim generators are the drop-in seam for real drivers.
**Broadcast back-pressure is load-bearing:** clients doze in Wi-Fi power save (TVs,
tablets), so `ws_broadcast` sends only when the socket is writable (zero-timeout
`select`), drops the frame for that client otherwise, and evicts after ~2 s of
continuous back-pressure; WS sockets get `SO_SNDTIMEO` 100 ms + `TCP_NODELAY` at
handshake. Never let one client's send block `net_task` — it froze every viewer.
Browser-side, `live.js` coalesces bursts (latest frame wins, firing bits OR-latched)
and applies to the DOM rAF-paced (80 ms floor — ≤12.5 Hz, and never faster than the
display actually paints).

**Still open (not a scaffold gap — real work):** the *real* acquisition drivers (ADS1115
precision analog, MCP23017 status, 74HC165 coil/injector activity, CKP/CMP capture via
RMT/GPTimer with 60-2 decode) that replace the sim generators field-by-field at the
bench, and the browser→server COMMAND handler (`ws_handler` currently only accepts the
handshake; the dashboard sends no commands since SimControls was removed).
